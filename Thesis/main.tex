\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
In this thesis, the author discusses the implementation of a Finite Difference Time Domain Method using the C++ programming language, to generate data for simulations of electromagnetic waves. This thesis aims to use terms that are as simple as possible, so that it can be understood easily by those who, like the author, have studied primarily computer science rather than physics. Three scenarios will be discussed here: the first with a one-dimensional domain, then a two-dimensional one, and lastly the three-dimensional implementation, which would have the most real-life applications. None of this would be possible however without the work of previous researchers and scientists. In particular, this project relies heavily on Maxwell's Equations for electromagnetics, which dictate the behavior of all electromagnetic waves in a static environment. After first discretizing the domain, the formulas are adapted to the specific scenario, resulting in update equations that calculate the value of the next step of the simulation. While doing so, the thesis goes over transverse modes and electromagnetic vector curls. After each scenario is discretized properly, it is possible to proceed to the code implementation, where each of the equations is adapted and added inside a loop. The result is then processed with the help of an external program to visualize the simulation in a way that is more easily understandable to humans. In the end, an appendix holds useful information that one can use should they intend to further work on this project, or implement it into their own work.

\begin{acknowledgements}
\addchaptertocentry{\acknowledgementname} % Add the acknowledgements to the table of contents
First and foremost I would like to thank my academic supervisor, Prof. Dr. Peter Thoma. It is only due to his patience, perseverance, and willingness to spend his time aiding me, that I was able to complete this project. Even before that, I would like to thank him for his course of Simulation Methods in the High Integrity Systems M.Sc. degree, which convinced me that such a subject would make an interesting thesis for me.

I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Falkenberg, not only for his assistance throughout my higher academic studies but also because I would not be able to officially start working on this thesis without his acceptance.

Thank you to my friends, who although far away have helped me keep my spirits high during a rather dark year not just for me, but for the world as a whole. It would have been difficult to push through to the end of this degree otherwise, if not impossible.

And lastly my deepest thanks to my parents, who taught me discipline and also self-acceptance. They did their best to set me up for a rich academic life, by straining themselves physically, mentally, and economically just so that I could have the best possibilities available to me. It will take an eternity to repay them for their sacrifices, but hopefully, this is, at the very least, a step in the right direction.

Sincerely,\\
Xhoni Robo
