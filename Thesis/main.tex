\begin{abstract}
\addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
This thesis is the final documentation for a project in the Master of Science degree of High Integrity Systems supervised by Prof. Dr. Peter Thoma and Prof. Dr. Egbert Falkenberg. In this thesis, the author will explain the basics of electromagnetic simulation and demonstrate a simple application that will produce both electric and magnetic field data, which can then be visualized through the help of third party applications such as Paraview\textsuperscript{\cite{paraview}}. 

This thesis is heavily focused on theoretical aspect of such an application, and as such the code will be simplistic and not use any advanced external libraries not included by default in the basic C++ package. The application will not have a User Interface (UI), therefore the only way to customize the initial values of the code variables would be through an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can handle C++, such as Eclipse \textsuperscript{\cite{eclipse}}. The benefit of not relying on any external open source libraries is the ability for this code to be used by any machine regardless of operating system and easy integration into applications that need such simulations.

Alongside this document, the project also included the code files found in the GitHub repository\textsuperscript{\cite{robo}}. As the base \LaTeX \space template of this thesis was found online\textsuperscript{\cite{template}}, these files are also included, with the license allowing viewing and modification so long as it is for a non-commercial use. After the official deadline of January 5th 2021, this project will be considered complete and no further changes will be made.

\begin{acknowledgements}
\addchaptertocentry{\acknowledgementname} % Add the acknowledgements to the table of contents
First and foremost I would like to thank my academic supervisor, Prof. Dr. Peter Thoma. It is only due to his patience, perseverance, and willingness to spend his time aiding me, that I was able to complete this project. Even before that, I would like to thank him for his course of Simulation Methods in the High Integrity Systems M.Sc. degree, that convinced me that such a subject would make an interesting thesis for me.

I would also like to the Prof. Dr. Falkenberg, not only for his assistance throughout my higher academic studies, but also because I would not be able to officially start working on this thesis without his acceptance.

Thank you to my friends, who although far away have helped me keep my spirits high during a rather dark year not just for me, but for the world as a whole. It would have been difficult to push through to the end of this degree otherwise, if not impossible.

And lastly, my deepest thanks to my parents, who taught me discipline, and also acceptance. They did their best to set me up for a rich academic life, by straining themselves physically, mentally, and economically just so that I could have the best possibilities available to me. It will take an eternity to repay them back for their sacrifices, but hopefully this is, at the very least, a step in the right direction.

Sincerely,\\
Xhoni Robo
